This is an academic type bloom filter for gpus.
This program is made to compare the performance of:

A regular bloom filter and a reguler bloom filter on the gpu

And

A PBF and a PBF on the gpu. (Probabilistic bloom filter).

================
Steps

1)Compile the source code:
	make

2)
In order to compare the regular bloom filter and the gpu bloom filter:

python CompareBloom.py

The output for the times will be located in data/reg/time.

The file names are in the format: numHash_x.txt,

where x is the number of hash functions. Each row contains a different batch size.

3) In order to compare the PBF and the GPU PBF.

python ComparePBF.py

The output for the times will be located in data/pbf/time.

The file names are in the format: numHash_x.txt,

where x is the number of hash functions. Each row contains a different batch size.

4) Specific arguments.

--hashStart The smallest number of hash functions
--hashEnd The maximum number of hash functions.
--hashInc The amount to increment the number of hash functions by.
--batchStart The smallest batch size
--batchEnd The biggest batch size
--batchInc The amount to increment the batch size by.

example:
	python CompareBloom.py --hashStart 10 --hashEnd 50 --hashInc 10 --batchStart 100000 --batchEnd 1000000 --batchInc 100000
